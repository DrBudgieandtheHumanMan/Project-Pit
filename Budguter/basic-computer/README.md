This is the schematic and BOM for the basic version of the Budguter (cheapo Altair 8800 knockoff using a Z80).
The basic computer only has the examine next, deposit and run/stop front panel functions of the orignal Mits Altair 8800.
This circut can be made on 4 breadboards and can be made in just a few hours!
This project was made in videos 1 - 4 of the Cheapo Breadboard Altair 8800 playlist (https://youtu.be/EPf2qaqPau0?feature=shared).
The RESET button in the schematic is just a jumper wire in the videos.
P.S. I don't know how to draw proper schematics, so hopefully it makes sense!
